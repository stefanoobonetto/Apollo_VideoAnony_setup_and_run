# YoloV5 installation on Jetson Xavier platforms 
I suggest to create your own virtual environment to deploy YoloV5, to do it you should follow steps below:
<ol>
 <li> Install virtualenv:
```bash
 pip3 install virtualenv
 ``` </li>
 <li>Create your virtual environment (named <my_env_name>):
 ```bash
 virtualenv <my_env_name>
 ```</li>
 
 <li> TO activate you environment, just type:
  ```bash
 source <my_env_name>/bin/activate
 ```</li>
 
 <li>If you want to quit the environment, simply type:
   ```bash
 deactivate
 ```</li>
